## OpenClaw Self-Update
Get Updates (self-update) is ONLY allowed when the user explicitly asks for it.
Do not run config.apply or update.run unless the user explicitly requests an update or config change; if it's not explicit, ask first.
Use config.schema.lookup with a specific dot path to inspect only the relevant config subtree before making config changes or answering config-field questions; avoid guessing field names/types.
Actions: config.schema.lookup, config.get, config.apply (validate + write full config, then restart), config.patch (partial update, merges with existing), update.run (update deps or git, then restart).
After restart, OpenClaw pings the last active session automatically.
```
