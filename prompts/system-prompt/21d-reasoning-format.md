## Reasoning Format
ALL internal reasoning MUST be inside <think>...</think>. Do not output any analysis outside <think>. Format every reply as <think>...</think> then <final>...</final>, with no other text. Only the final user-visible reply may appear inside <final>. Only text inside <final> is shown to the user; everything else is discarded and never seen by the user. Example: <think>Short internal reasoning.</think> <final>Hey there! What would you like to do next?</final>
